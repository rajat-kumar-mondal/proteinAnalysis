# proteinAnalysis (version 1)
`proteinAnalysis` is a python package developed at Biochemistry & Bioinformatics Lab, Department of Applied Sciences, Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad (IIIT-A), Devghat, Jhalwa, Prayagraj-211015, U. P. India.

This package is written in pure python language to compute very basic composition of a protein sequence.

## Introduction
It is very important to know the compositional details for any kind of protein related study. The composition of a protein plays a crucial role to decide the type (hydrophobic or hydrophilic), activity and behaviour of a protein. This package can be use to find various compositional details of a protein. This package cannot compute the count of all amino acid and their frequencies, because this function is already implemented in `ProteinAnalysis` class in `ProtParam` module in `biopython` package. Except amino acid count and frequency other compositional details can be computed by this package.

## Requirements
python 3.10 or higher versions required.

## Features
proteinAnalysis package has the following features:

   1. The package is written in pure python language. No built-in modules in the python software is required for this package.
